Color detection involves identifying and isolating specific colors within an image. This process typically includes:

Color Space Conversion: Transforming the image from the default RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color space to a more perceptually uniform color space like HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) or HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness). These color spaces separate chromatic content (hue) from intensity (saturation and value/lightness), making color-based segmentation more robust to lighting variations.

Thresholding: Defining lower and upper bounds for the target color in the chosen color space. Pixels within this range are considered part of the target color.

Masking: Creating a binary mask where pixels that fall within the defined color range are set to 255 (white), and all other pixels are set to 0 (black). This mask isolates the regions of interest.

Bitwise Operations: Applying the mask to the original image using bitwise operations (e.g., cv2.bitwise_and()) to extract the regions corresponding to the target color.
